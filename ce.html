        In other words, a computer engineer designs, builds, and maintains computer hardware — they will often also work with the software aspect of
        computers to ensure it works as intended.

        To do this, some of the skills you might need include programming efficiently, testing programs, webpage development, data analysis, and
        algorithms. In addition, some more complicated areas of study are artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and networks.

            Since computer engineers are a subset of the broader engineer category, a career in this field requires a traditional 4-year university
            bachelor's degree in computer engineering (there are a few exceptions but you will have more limited job opportunities without an
            engineering degree). The degree can obtain this at some Canadian universities. They have an application process that involves some
            combination of your high school marks and extra-curriculars (i.e. competitions, volunteering, jobs). Here are some links for more
            information:

            Virtually no one will hire you unless you have built tangible technology-based products and/or developed modular programs. However, this
            does not mean you will be trapped in an endless cycle of "need experience / need job"! For the actually building part, it is difficult to
            attain experience without external help (i.e. through a school). This is because you would need to buy or borrow a lot of the components
            needed to make something, which can be very costly. If you do choose to self-learn these skills, a worthy investment would be a Raspberry
            Pi or Arduino. Using these "mini-computers", you can make a lot of IoT products (Internet of Things). On the other hand, it is much more
            accessible to self-learn the programming component, you can follow free online courses — all you need is access to a computer (visit the
            public library or your school if you do not one). Here are some well-known sources for tutorials:

            Another really good way to get experience is through a cooperative education program in university or high school. This allows you to
            spend a couple of months at a company to gain work experience.
