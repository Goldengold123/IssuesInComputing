        This means that careers in computing refers to jobs that involve using computers.<sup title="duh">[1]</sup> But this doesn't imply that
        everything related to computers is a career in computing. For instance, even though an accountant would use technology and computers, it is
        not a career in computing.

        As for what a career in computing actually is, there are three major fields:
        <a href="cs.html">computer science</a>, <a href="ce.html">computer engineering</a>, and <a href="it.html">information technology</a>.
