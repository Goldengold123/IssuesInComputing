        Some of the skills you might need include programming, game development, webpage development, data analysis, and algorithms. More advanced jobs will require studying additional topics such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and
        networks.

            A lot of jobs within the computer sceince field require at least a 4-year university bachelor's degree in computer. You can obtain this at most Canadian universities. They have an application process that involves some combination of your
            high school marks and extra-curriculars (i.e. competitions, volunteering, jobs). Here are some links for more information:

          <p>This is where you will learn the skills you need stated above.</p>

            However, such a degree is not necessarily required. If you have enough practical experience (see next section), official certifications, participated in hackathons, and/or followed along bootcamps, submiting a resume with an outline of
            your experience in computer science can get you employed — without the costly bachelor's degree!

            Virtually no one will hire you unless you have developed modular programs. However, this does not mean you will be trapped in an endless cycle of "need experience / need job"! The best part about careers in computing, in particular those
            involved with the software development aspect, is that one can build their own programs without actually being part of a company. There are countless online courses to follow along to develop your programming skillset — all you need is
            access to a computer (visit the public library or your school if you do not have access). Here are some well-known sources for tutorials:

            Data Scientists and Analysts dissect data sets to help provide understanding of trends and the causes of it by finding patterns. Using the information, algorithms and models are created to predict future outcomes, which helps the business
            make stronger decisions with regards to its products and services. This process may involve applying machine learning principles, managing the data wtih SQL, or a combination with Python. To automate and speed up this process, experience
            in deep learning and the respective pattern recognition techniques may be required. Working in this role will require strong analytical and problem-solving abilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, there is a slight difference in regards to what specifically data scientists do compared to data analysts. Data scientists tend to ask questions with regards to the data, during and after their analysis of the trends. Data
            analysts usually already have a question in mind, an objective as to what they want to conclude using the data sets. They also work together: data scientists may integrate several sets of data into a database for data analysts. For both
            of these roles, there may be subcategories that details a more specific title (i.e. business intelligence analyst, medical analyst).
          </p>
          <p>
            Data Scientists have quite a high compensation compared to the national average. According to
            <a href="https://www.glassdoor.ca/Salaries/data-scientist-salary-SRCH_KO0,14.htm">Glassdoor</a>, the average base pay (2023, Canada) is $91,431 per year, with $9,985 in bonuses. Lead Data Scientists are paid, on average, $125,091 per
            year. On the other hand, for Data Analysts, according to <a href="https://www.glassdoor.ca/Salaries/data-analyst-salary-SRCH_KO0,12.htm">Glassdoor</a>, the average base pay (2023, Canada) is $65,041 per year, with $4,797 in bonuses.
            Senior Data Analysts are paid, on average, $88,020 per year.
