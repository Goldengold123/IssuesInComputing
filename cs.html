        Some of the skills you might need include programming, game development, webpage development, data analysis, and algorithms. More advanced
        jobs will require studying additional topics such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and networks.

            A lot of jobs within the computer sceince field require at least a 4-year university bachelor's degree in computer. You can obtain this at
            most Canadian universities. They have an application process that involves some combination of your high school marks and
            extra-curriculars (i.e. competitions, volunteering, jobs). Here are some links for more information:

            However, such a degree is not necessarily required. If you have enough practical experience (see next section), official certifications,
            participated in hackathons, and/or followed along bootcamps, submiting a resume with an outline of your experience in computer science can
            get you employed — without the costly bachelor's degree!

            Virtually no one will hire you unless you have developed modular programs. However, this does not mean you will be trapped in an endless
            cycle of "need experience / need job"! The best part about careers in computing, in particular those involved with the software
            development aspect, is that one can build their own programs without actually being part of a company. There are countless online courses
            to follow along to develop your programming skillset — all you need is access to a computer (visit the public library or your school if
            you do not have access). Here are some well-known sources for tutorials:

            Another way to get experience is through a cooperative education program in university or high school. This allows you to spend a couple
            of months at a company to gain work experience.

      <h2>Software Engineer — Highlighted Job Role</h2>

            Software Engineers work alongside a team to design and build applications used on a computer to address a need (or want) of a group of
            people. The entire software development cycle (deisgn, building, testing, and maintenance) is typically incorporated and assigned to
            members of the team. Working in this role will require you to be fluent in the programming language used (specific language depends on
            what the exact product is). In addition, you must be knowledgeable in regards to the restrictions on technology (i.e. managing private
            information).
          </p>
          <p>
            Within this job role, there are two main subdivisions: back-end devleopers and front-end developers. Back-end developers focus on ensuring
            the actual application works; this includes enforcing IT standards, documentation, and updating the technologies used. Front-end
            developers focus on the user interface; this includes building the user interface and working alongside graphic designers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Software Engineers have quite a high compensation compared to the national average. According to
            <a href="https://www.glassdoor.ca/Salaries/software-engineer-salary-SRCH_KO0,17.htm">Glassdoor</a>, the average base pay (2023, Canada) is
            $91,358 per year, with $10,927 in bonuses. Senior-level Software Engineers are paid, on average, $118,089 per year.
