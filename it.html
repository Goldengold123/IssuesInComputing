        In other words, a computer engineer designs, builds, and maintains computer hardware — they will often also work with the software aspect of
        computers to ensure it works as intended.

      <p>
        To do this, some of the skills you might learn include programming efficiently, testing programs, webpage development, data analysis, and
        algorithms. In addition, some more complicated areas of study are artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and networks.

            Nearly all jobs within the computer sceince field require at least a 4-year university bachelor's degree in computer. You can obtain this
            at most Canadian universities. They have an application process that involves some combination of your high school marks and
            extra-curriculars (i.e. competitions, volunteering, jobs). Here are some links for more information:

            Virtually no one will hire you unless you have developed modular programs. However, this does not mean you will be trapped in an endless
            cycle of "need experience / need job"! The best part about careers in computing, in particular those involved with the software
            development aspect, is that one can build their own programs without actually being part of a company. There are countless online courses
            to follow along to develop your programming skillset — all you need is access to a computer (visit the public library or your school if
            you do not have access). Here are some well-known sources for tutorials:

            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>Full Stack Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (NodeJS, ReactJS)</li>
            <li>Version Control: GitHub, Git</li>
            <li>Algorithms and Data Structures</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Another really good way to get experience is through a cooperative education program in university or high school. This allows you to
            spend a couple of months at a company to gain work experience.
