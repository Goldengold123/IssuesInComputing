        To do this, some of the skills you might need include programming, cloud computing, data analysis, project management, and cybersecurity. In addition, some more complicated areas of study are artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and
        networks.

            Careers in information technology are more accommodating in regards to the amount of formal education received in contrast to other fields in computing. One potential source of education in preparation for an IT job would be a bechelor's
            degree in information technology or a similar field. However, this is definitely not required: there are many places you can obtain certifications to prove your competence. Here are some examples:

            Without experience in using the technologies (or similar ones) used in the job role, it is very difficult to get hired. However, this does not mean you will be trapped in an endless cycle of "need experience / need job"! A lot of the
            skills for IT jobs can be self-taught and practiced (possibly even for free!), with access to a computer. First, research your area of interest for certifications, which come with courses/tutorials for you to learn the basics — and a
            certification to validate your progress when you complete the course. Then, create some of your own applications: this can be as simple as using Microsoft 365 to organizing a public database.

          <p>Use the keywords in skills mentioned above to get you started.</p>

                Another really good way to get experience is through a cooperative education program in high school or university. In Ontario, the Specialist High Skills Major (IT) allows you to follow a more guided pathway: a bundle of courses,
                certifications, and a cooperative education placement in a related setting. If you complete all the requirements, you get a red seal on your OSSD!

            Network Administrators validates whether the organization's networks are functioning properly, maintaining and troubleshooting the system of computers that share information as necessary. They must also apply standard security principles
            to help deviate the chances of data breaches and unwanted hacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within this job role, some tasks you will find yourself doing are managing network-related devices and applications (routers, firewalls), applying principles of security to protect those networks, establishing VPNs, and troubleshooting
            network connection issues for users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Network Administrators have around the national average compensation. According to
            <a href="https://www.glassdoor.ca/Salaries/network-administrator-salary-SRCH_KO0,21.htm">Glassdoor</a>, the average base pay (2023, Canada) is $68,970 per year, with $3,455 in bonuses. Senior Network Administrators are paid, on average,
            $91,712 per year.
