        In other words, a computer engineer designs, builds, and maintains computer hardware — they will often also work with the software aspect of
        computers to ensure it works as intended.

        To do this, some of the skills you might need include programming efficiently, testing programs, webpage development, data analysis, and
        algorithms. In addition, some more complicated areas of study are artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and networks.

            Since computer engineers are a subset of the broader engineer category, a career in this field requires a traditional 4-year university
            bachelor's degree in computer engineering (there are a few exceptions but you will have more limited job opportunities without an
            engineering degree). The degree can obtain this at some Canadian universities. They have an application process that involves some
            combination of your high school marks and extra-curriculars (i.e. competitions, volunteering, jobs). Here are some links for more
            information:

            Without experience in building tangible technology-based products and/or developed modular programs, it is very difficult to get hired.
            However, this does not mean you will be trapped in an endless cycle of "need experience / need job"! For the actually building part, it is
            difficult to attain experience without external help (i.e. through a school). This is because you would need to buy or borrow a lot of the
            components needed to make something, which can be very costly. If you do choose to self-learn these skills, a worthy investment would be a
            Raspberry Pi or Arduino. Using these "mini-computers", you can make a lot of IoT products (Internet of Things). On the other hand, it is
            much more accessible to self-learn the programming component, you can follow free online courses — all you need is access to a computer
            (visit the public library or your school if you do not one). Here are some well-known sources for tutorials:

            Another really good way to get experience is through a cooperative education program in university or high school. This allows you to
            spend a couple of months at a company to gain work experience.

      <h2>Software Engineer / Developer — Highlighted Job Role</h2>

        <div>
          <p>
            Software Engineers / Developer work alongside a team to design and build applications used on a computer to address a need (or want) of a
            group of people. The entire software development cycle (deisgn, building, testing, and maintenance) is typically incorporated and assigned
            to members of the team. Working in this role will require you to be fluent in the programming language used (specific language depends on
            what the exact product is). In addition, you must be knowledgeable in regards to the restrictions on technology (i.e. managing private
            information).
          </p>
          <p>
            Within this job role, there are two main subdivisions: back-end devleopers and front-end developers. Back-end developers focus on ensuring
            the actual application works; this includes enforcing IT standards, documentation, and updating the technologies used. Front-end
            developers focus on the user interface; this includes building the user interface and working alongside graphic designers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Software Engineers have quite a high compensation compared to the national average. According to
            <a href="https://www.glassdoor.ca/Salaries/software-engineer-salary-SRCH_KO0,17.htm">Glassdoor</a>, the average base pay (2023, Canada) is
            $91,358 per year, with $10,927 in bonuses. Senior-level Software Engineers are paid, on average, $118,089 per year.
