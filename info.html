    <h1>General Information</h1>

    <p>According to Google (definition provided by Oxford Languages):</p>
    <div class="defn">
      <term>com·put·ing</term>
      <type>noun</type>
      <def>the use or operation of computers.</def>
    </div>

    <p>This means that careers in computing refers to jobs that involve using computers.<sup title="duh">[1]</sup></p>
    <p>But this doesn't imply that everything related to computers is a career in computing. Clearly [insert job] isn't.</p>
    <p>
      As for what a career in computing actually is, there are three major fields:
      <a href="cs.html">computer science</a>, <a href="ce.html">computer engineering</a>, and <a href="it.html">information technology</a>.
